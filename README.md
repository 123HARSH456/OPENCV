![OpenCV](https://img.shields.io/badge/opencv-%23white.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=opencv&logoColor=white)


Welcome to my OpenCV repository! This repo is a collection of projects and scripts covering everything from OpenCV basics to advanced computer vision applications like hand tracking, pose detection, face mesh, and face detection using MediaPipe and OpenCV.

## 🔰 Basics (OpenCV Essentials)

-Reading, displaying, and saving images & videos

-Drawing shapes and text on images

-Image processing (grayscale, blurring, thresholding, edge detection)

-Image transformations (resize, crop, rotate, perspective warp)

## 🧠 Advanced Projects (with MediaPipe)

-Hand Tracking: Detect and track hand landmarks in real-time

-Pose Detection: Full body pose estimation with landmark detection

-Face Detection: Real-time face detection using MediaPipe

-Face Mesh: High-resolution face landmark detection with 468 points
