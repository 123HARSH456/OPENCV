![OpenCV](https://img.shields.io/badge/opencv-%23white.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=opencv&logoColor=white)


Welcome to my OpenCV repository! This repo is a collection of projects and scripts covering everything from OpenCV basics to advanced computer vision applications like hand tracking, pose detection, face mesh, and face detection using MediaPipe and OpenCV. It also consists of my projects like Hand gesture volume control.

## ðŸ”° Basics (OpenCV Essentials)

-Reading, displaying, and saving images & videos

-Drawing shapes and text on images

-Image processing (grayscale, blurring, thresholding)

-Image transformations (resize, crop, rotate, perspective warp)

## ðŸ§  Advanced Projects (with MediaPipe)

-Hand Tracking: Detect and track hand landmarks in real-time

-Pose Detection: Full body pose estimation with landmark detection

-Face Detection: Real-time face detection using MediaPipe

-Face Mesh: High-resolution face landmark detection with 468 points

-Volume Control using Gestures - Control your device volume using just your hands.
